\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Class to store position of a field. 

Coordinate systems which is going to be used for this hexagonal simulation is q, r for two axes and s for the third (however, s is \char`\"{}artificial\char`\"{} since s = -\/q -\/ r) 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
